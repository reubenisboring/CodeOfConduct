# NerdPing CoC
The binding Code of Conduct which community members and the staff team of NerdPing must abide by.

## Moderation
NerdPing is moderated by a chosen board of staff members. There is a hierarchy within this board, however it is frowned upon to 'pull rank' on others in unnecessary circumstances. This hierarchy is determined on whether a staff member is that of a `moderator` or `manager`.

### Guidelines for applying policies
You must not have a significant amount of vaild complaints against you, and also have a "clean" history on the teamspeak. This would be from evidence and knowledge from relevent staff. 

### Guidelines for elevating issues to management
Issues range from fellow staff not abiding the rules set out in the "Rules channel" in teamspeak, a simple poke to a lead member of staff should be sufficent. Otherwise an email to [toby@nerdping.com](mail-to://toby@nerdping.com) or to [salty@nerdping.com](mail-to://salty@nerdping.com). `Kicks` and `Bans` are required to have a relevent reason and a appropriate corresponding time limit assigned to them in the case of a a ban.


## Recruitment
For recruiting staff to NerdPing there are two main strategies, listed below. More often than not the former strategy is used to select `moderating staff`, whereas the latter used to select `management staff`.

#### Application
Application requires a member to submit and application to the staff team to be evaluated and reviewed. Said applicant can find a `moderating staff` or `management staff` application [here](https://github.com/nerdping/forms). The application must be correctly and completely filled in, unless stated otherwise. The application may submit the application via email to [applications@nerdping.com](mail-to://applications@nerdping.com). We aim to respond to applications within 7 days.

If the application is sufficient, we will invite the applicant for an informal interview.

Staff withhold the right to deny applications upon receipt, to revoke applications before interview, to cancel the interview, to rearrange times and dates of the interview, and to dismiss the interview.

#### Invitation
Invitation is where an existing member of staff sees a member of NerdPing, or someone unaffiliated with NerdPing, and would like to bring them onto the staff team. Often the motive for doing so is that the invitee possess tangible goods or skills which we desire in NerdPing, and feel both the organisation and the invitee would benefit by them joining the staff team.

Invitations are often initiated via a formal email, semi-formal IM message (such as Steam, Facebook, or Twitter), or through speech. Once the invitee has expressed interest in the position, we shall invite them for interview.

#### Interview
Interviews often occur on our TeamSpeak3 server, however there is no obligation for the interview to take place there, and we will be happy to use another means such as Google Hangout or Skype. Present in the interview there is likely to be two existing staff members present, this ensures that an unbiased view is formed on the interviewee, and to try and change up the conversation between interviewers.
